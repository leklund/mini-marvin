Mini Marvin - a simple IRC notifier in ruby with a brain the size of a planet.

Example:

  MiniMarvin.loathing({:server => 'hostname',  :port => '6667', :password => 'password', :ssl => true, :nick => 'marv'}) do |paranoid_android|
   paranoid_android.gripe("#heartofgold", "this will all end in tears")
  end

The gripe method takes an options hash. The only available option is 'join' which if true, will
join the channel before sending the notice. This is required for channels that have '+n' set.

  paranoid_android.gripe("#heartofgold", "this will all end in tears", {:join => true})

Why?

Works great for deploy notifications with capistrano or other occasional irc notifications
for which you don't need a bot always running.
